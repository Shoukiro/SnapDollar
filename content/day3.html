      <li>Greed and fear will destroy your wealth—control them.</li>
      <li>Don’t trade with emotions—trade with a plan.</li>
      <li>Time in the market beats timing the market.</li>
      <li>Start small, learn big.</li>
      <li>Never follow tips blindly—do your own research.</li>
      <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
      <li>Protect your capital—profits come second.</li>
      <li>Patience makes more money than panic.</li>
      <li>The market rewards discipline, not desperation.</li>
      <li>Diversify—never put all your eggs in one basket.</li>
      <li>Losing is part of learning—accept it, analyze it, grow from it.</li>
      <li>Invest in what you understand, not what’s trending.</li>
      <li>Quick profits come with quick losses.</li>
      <li>The market is not your enemy—it’s your mirror.</li>

      <li>Don’t chase stocks—let your strategy lead.</li>
      <li>Focus on long-term wealth, not short-term thrill.</li>
